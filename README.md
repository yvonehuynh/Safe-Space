                Vision Behind Safe Space
                Safe Space was created to allow all users to express themselves in a safe environment.

                Not everyone has a support system they can turn to and for most, bugging their friends and families for the hundreth time is the last thing they want to do.

                This application was inspired by Calm Harm; a mobile app that helps those who self-harm distract themselves from the urge. Safe Space is an extension of that, but for all users who are just going through something rough and need to vent it out. 

                Safe Space is anonymous. We do not save your data, info, or activity records. No one will know what you are thinking. This is your Safe Space.
